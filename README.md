Taylor Diamond

I am a senior majoring in Environmental Studies, with a minor in Economics and Legal Studies. I'm interested in careers within the environmental advocacy and research fields, and I took this course for interest and to gain relevant coding experience. Some of my favorite hobbies include playing chess, running, and hiking.
